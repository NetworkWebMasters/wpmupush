# WPMU Push
Display notifications to your site visitors or logged in users when there is a new post. A proven method to increase user engagement. Works with latest Chrome and Firefox browsers along with WordPress Multisite and Standard WP sites. On Multisite you may either Network Activate this plugin or you may install it on a case by case basis within the subsites you choose.

When you deactivate the plugin, a clean uninstall is ran that deletes all database tables associated with the plugin.

This plugin currently works as an onsite notification of new posts. Great for greeting users and telling them what's new. On member sites, this can really be handy as well for real-time notifications.

These push notifications can be extended beyond the current capability if you use this plugin along with using the Google App for Push Notifications and you register your website with Google. That is optional and requires a few additional steps. But right out-the-box WPMU Push works with no additional setup and works as an excellent way to grab your users attention.

I have plans to implement comment notifications down the line, such as notifications of replies to comments and admin notifications of all new comments.

I welcome plugin contributors.
