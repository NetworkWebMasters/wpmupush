# WPMU Push
Display notifications to your site visitors or logged in users when there is a new post. A proven method to increase user engagement. Works with latest Chrome and Firefox browsers along with WordPress Multisite and Standard WP sites. On Multisite you may either Network Activate this plugin or you may install it on a case by case basis within the subsites you choose.

#### Important
After downloading from Github, you MUST rename the zip file from wpmupush-master.zip to wpmupush.zip to avoid any potential issues. I'll fix this later on so you wont need to rename it, but for now you should rename the file to wpmupush.zip then upload it like usualy to your WordPress site to install and activate.

#### About Deactivation
When you deactivate the plugin, a clean uninstall is ran that deletes all database tables associated with the plugin.

#### More Information
This plugin currently works as an onsite notification of new posts. Great for greeting users and telling them what's new. On member sites, this can really be handy as well for real-time notifications.

These push notifications can be extended beyond the current capability if you use this plugin with the Push API (https://w3c.github.io/push-api/) and run a Service Worker over https (http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/service-worker/introduction/). However, that is optional and requires a few additional steps. But right out-the-box WPMU Push works with no additional setup and works as an excellent way to grab your users attention.

#### The Future
I have plans to implement comment notifications down the line, such as notifications of replies to comments and admin notifications of all new comments.

#### Contribute
I'd like to encourage plugin contributors.

#### Lisense
